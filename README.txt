For any question, request, advice feel free to contact me. Also if you want
to make it a bigger project. This is my first try in making a useful software
to simplify some lab experiences in Science of Environment and Nature at
University of Genoa, Italy.

I would like to thank Lorenzo Magnone for the idea.
